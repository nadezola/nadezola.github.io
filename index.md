## About

Currently, I am working as a Project Assistant at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), Austria. 

I am also pursuing a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof),
the current rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), and I am proud to work under his guidance. 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University), graduating from the [Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics),
which is also the alma mater of such outstanding mathematicians as Kolmogorov, Chebyshev, and many others.

My primary research interests focus on Deep Neural Networks 
in the field of Computer Vision, particularly in Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, 
Human Attribute Recognition, Human Pose Estimation, and Domain Adaptation, with applications 
to Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems, Autonomious Driving, and Robotics.
