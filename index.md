Currently, I am working as a University Project Assistant in the [LRS Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/learning-recognition-surveillance) (Learing, Recognition and Surveillace)
at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology). 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University) graduating 
[Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics),
which also was the alma mater of such outstanding mathematicians as Kolmogorov, Chebyshev and many others.

I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science being supervised by [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof),
who currently serves as rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology).  

My primary research interests are focused on Deep Neural Networks 
in the field of Computer Vision, particularly for Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, 
Human Attribute Recognition, Human Re-Identification, Intelligent Video Surveillance systems, as well as 
Monocular Depth Estimation and adverse weather condition simulations.
