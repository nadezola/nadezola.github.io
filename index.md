## About

I am currently working as a Project Assistant at the [Institute of Visual Computing](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), Austria. 

Alongside my work, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof)
(currently the rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology)), within the team of [Dr. Horst Possegger](https://snototter.github.io/research/). 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University), graduating from the [Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics) — a globally recognized
university with a strong reputation in academic and research mathematical circles, known since the time of
Kolmogorov, Chebyshev, and many other outstanding mathematicians who worked there.

My primary research interests lie in Deep Neural Networks (AI) for Computer Vision, with a particular focus
on Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, Human Pose Estimation, 
Attribute Recognition, Instance Segmentation, Domain Adaptation, and Visual Language Models.
The methods have applications in Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems, Autonomous Driving, 
and Automated Industrial Processing.

Our team works closely with leading industry partners such as [Infineon Technologies Austria AG](https://www.infineon.com/), 
[AVL List GmbH](https://www.avl.com/en), [ASFINAG Bau Management GmbH](https://www.asfinag.at/), [KNAPP AG](https://www.knapp.com/en/), 
[Saubermacher Dienstleistungs AG](https://saubermacher.at/),and others, collaborating to develop and transfer cutting-edge technologies 
into real-world industrial applications.

We also collaborate on government- and city- funded projects (e.g., from the [Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, 
Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK)](https://www.bmimi.gv.at/en.html)), 
integrating smart technologies into sustainable traffic management and urban planning to enhance road user safety,
especially for pedestrians and cyclists — with a strong focus on climate action, 
environmental protection, energy efficiency, and sustainable mobility.
