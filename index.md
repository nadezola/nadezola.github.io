## About

Currently, I am working as a University Project Assistant in the [LRS Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/learning-recognition-surveillance) (Learing, Recognition and Surveillace)
at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology). 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University), graduating from the [Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics),
which is also the alma mater of outstanding mathematicians such as Kolmogorov, Chebyshev, and many others.

I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof),
who currently serves as the rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology).  

My primary research interests focus on Deep Neural Networks 
in the field of Computer Vision, particularly for Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, 
Human Attribute Recognition, Human Re-Identification, Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems, 
Monocular Depth Estimation, and simulations of adverse weather conditions for improved machine learning model robustness.
