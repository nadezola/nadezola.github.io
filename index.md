## About

Currently, I am working as a University Project Assistant in the [LRS Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/learning-recognition-surveillance) (Learing, Recognition and Surveillace)
at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), Austria. 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University), graduating from the [Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics),
which is also the alma mater of such outstanding mathematicians as Kolmogorov, Chebyshev, and many others.

I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof),
the current rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), and I am proud to work under his guidance. 

My primary research interests focus on Deep Neural Networks 
in the field of Computer Vision, particularly for Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, 
Human Attribute Recognition and Pose Esimation, and Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems.
