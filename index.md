## About

Currently, I am working as a Project Assistant at the [Institute of Visual Computing](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home) 
at [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology), Austria. 

Alongside my work, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Horst Bischof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Bischof)
(currently the rector of [Graz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz_University_of_Technology)), within the team of [Dr. Horst Possegger](https://snototter.github.io/research/). 

I received my master's degree in Mathematics from [M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University
(MSU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University), graduating from the [Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics) â€” a globally recognized
university with a strong reputation in academic mathematical circles, known since the time of
Kolmogorov, Chebyshev, and many other outstanding mathematicians who worked there.

My primary research interests lie in Deep Neural Networks (AI) for Computer Vision, with a particular focus
on Multiple Object Detection and Tracking, Human Pose Estimation, 
Attribute Recognition, Instance Segmentation, and Domain Adaptation.
The methods have applications in Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems, Autonomous Driving, 
and Automated Industrial Processing.
